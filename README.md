# TriviaChallenge
This JavaFX application implements a trivia game where users answer multiple-choice questions, earning 10 points for correct answers and losing 5 for incorrect ones. Questions are randomly selected from a file, ensuring no repetition during a session. The game tracks scores and allows players to start a new game or end the session.
